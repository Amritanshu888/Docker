But in case of docker images there may be compatibility issues.(Let's say i have a windows machine, in this windows machine i cannot install docker images that are of linux, if i install and try to communicate with the os kernel it might not be possible -> it will be possible if the os kernel supports , i.e. rightnow if u consider windows 10 or greater this supports even dockerlinux images also but windows version < 10 doesn't).
